Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversation?"

She tried to imagine what a rabbit with a waistcoat pocket and a watch might be like, but it was a difficult thing to do. "Perhaps it's a magic rabbit," thought Alice. "Or maybe I'm just dreaming."
