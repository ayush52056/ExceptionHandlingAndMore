Alice had never seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch before. She followed the White Rabbit down a rabbit-hole without thinking about how she would get out. "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well."

It felt like she was falling for a very long time. The cupboards and bookshelves on the walls of the well rushed past her, and she wondered if she would ever reach the bottom.
