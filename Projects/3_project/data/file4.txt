As she was falling, she noticed that the walls of the well were lined with cupboards and bookshelves. She tried to look down and make out what was coming after her, but it was too dark to see anything. Alice noticed that she was not falling very slowly, but she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her.

Finally, Alice landed with a thud at the bottom of the well. She was in a large, dimly lit room with many doors. Alice stood up and brushed off her dress, feeling a bit shaken but curious about her surroundings.
